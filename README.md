## Ochopod

### Overview

This project is a small [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) package you can use to boot your
[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) containers. It is configured to interface with
[**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) or various [**Apache Mesos**](http://mesos.apache.org/)
frameworks and coordinates how a given family of containers should cluster together at run-time. It transparently
manages dependencies and port remapping as well. In short you effectively apply an _overlay_ to your provisioning stack
that enabled you to do more !

Ochopod internally relies on [**Apache Zookeeper**](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) for synchronization and metadata
storage.

### Ochopod + Mesos + Marathon

Please have a look at our [**Ochothon**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochothon) stack and see how we built a
quick PaaS on top of [**Marathon**](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) including a comprehensive tool suite, a
cool web-shell, a tiny cli and more !

### Ochopod + K8S

On a similar note [**Ochonetes**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochonetes) will run on top of a
[**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) stack and is equally cool !

### Your base image

In case you had not noticed you can build this repo as a Docker image ! This will give you a basic Ubuntu container
that includes our code, Python 2.7 and the handy supervisor package. You can find it on the
[**Docker hub**](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) as the _paugamo/pod_ image.

### Documentation

You can [**peruse our online documentation**](http://autodesk-cloud.github.io/ochopod/) for examples, design notes,
API docs and more !

The [**Sphinx**](http://sphinx-doc.org/) materials can be found under docs/. Just go in there and build for your
favorite target, for instance:

```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The docs will be written to _docs/_build/html_. This is all Sphinx based and you have many options and knobs to
tweak should you want to customize the output.
