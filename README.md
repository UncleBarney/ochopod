## Ochopod

### Overview

This project is a small [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) package you can use to boot your
[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) containers. It is configured to interface with various
[**Apache Mesos**](http://mesos.apache.org/) frameworks and coordinates how a given family of containers should
cluster together at run-time. It transparently manages dependencies and port remapping as well.

Ochopod uses the [**Apache Zookeeper**](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) ensemble used by Mesos for synchronization
and data storage, so that you do not have to add yet another piece to the puzzle. The SDK also comes with a set of
command line tools you can use to automate operations around your containers !

### Documentation

You can [**peruse our online documentation**](http://autodesk-cloud.github.io/ochopod/) for examples, design notes,
API docs and more !

The [**Sphinx**](http://sphinx-doc.org/) materials can be found under docs/. Just go in there and build for your
favorite target, for instance:

```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The docs will be written to _docs/_build/html_. This is all Sphinx based and you have many options and knobs to
tweak should you want to customize the output.
